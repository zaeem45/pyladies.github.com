How to submit an article or event
=====================================

* Fork the https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies.com-articles or https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies.com-events projects on github
* In your local branch, place your article or event in its respective project directory.
* The content must be formatted using RestructuredText, MarkDown, or (as a last resort) plain text.
* Don't submit the rendered HTML.
* Submit a pull request
* The maintainers of this site will then review and either publish or reject your article submission.

Why articles and events may get rejected
========================================

There are a number of reasons why this may have occurred:

* Inappropriate content submitted
* Spelling or grammatical errors
* Pull request included the rendered HTML

How to submit a static page
===========================

Simply create a RST or MD file in the Pages directory. Its title will appear in the navigation in TitleCase.
